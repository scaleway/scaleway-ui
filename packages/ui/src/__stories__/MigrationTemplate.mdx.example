A description of it...

Example:

```tsx
import { OldComponent } from '@scaleway/ui'

const MyComponent = () => (
  <OldComponent>
      My text
  </OldComponent />
)
```

Becomes:

```tsx
import { NewComponent } from '@scaleway/ui'

const MyComponent = () => (
  <NewComponent>
      My text
  </NewComponent />
)
```

## Old and new props matching

- `children` &rarr; `children`: No changes

etc...
