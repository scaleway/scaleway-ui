# Theme generator

Theme generator helps you to create a new theme for your project. By just giving one name and color for each sentiments
you want to use, you can generate a new theme and use it in your project.

## How does it work?

You basically just need to fill this form with the name and color of each sentiment you want to use in your project.
You need to define the darkest color of each sentiment, and the generator will automatically generate the other
shades.
