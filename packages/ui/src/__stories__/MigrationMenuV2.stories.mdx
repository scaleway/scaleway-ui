# Migrate Menu to MenuV2

## `placement` prop

The `placement` prop has been updated and now uses the values from the internal `Popup` component. That means `top` and `bottom` are still valid, but the following values are no longer working:

- `bottom-end`
- `bottom-start`
- `top-end`
- `top-start`

And the following values are now valid:

- `left`
- `right`

## `disclosure` prop

The `disclosure` prop object argument only has a `visible` property.

## `children` prop

The `children` prop no longer have a popover argument.
