# Migrate to the new Button version

Welcome to the migration of the new version of button, here we will see how to easily migrate to the new version of the component.

## Variants match

<ThemeWrapper>
  <Variants />
</ThemeWrapper>

## Size match

<ThemeWrapper>
  <Sizes />
</ThemeWrapper>

## Others Old/New props matching

- `progress` &rarr; : Loader (if prop `isLoading` if provided) replaces or use the `icon` spot. If you have no icon you can still use `iconPosition="right"` to put the Loader on the right.

---

- `as` &rarr; : Button do not support `as` prop and always renders a button expect if you provide an href prop then an anchor will be rendered.

---

- `action` &rarr; : Button do not support `support` prop. Simply provide an `icon` without `children`.

---

- `extend` &rarr; : We removed this behavior, we recommand to still use a `icon` + `text (children)`..

---

- `iconSize` &rarr; : Button do not support `iconSize` prop, the icon size is define internally depending of variant/size to make it consistent.
