# Migrate to the new Button version

Welcome to the migration of the new version of button, here we will see how to easily migrate to the new version of the component.

## Variants match

<ThemeWrapper>
  <Variants />
</ThemeWrapper>

## Size match

<ThemeWrapper>
  <Sizes />
</ThemeWrapper>

> **_NOTE:_**
> - Inside `EmptyState` the Button size is `large`.
> - `xsmall` size should only be used for links converted into buttons.

## Others Old/New props matching

- `progress` &rarr; Loader (if prop `isLoading` if provided) replaces or use the `icon` spot. If you have no icon you can still use `iconPosition="right"` to put the Loader on the right.

---

- `as` &rarr; Button do not support `as` prop and always renders a button expect if you provide an href prop then an anchor will be rendered.

---

- `action` &rarr; Button do not support `action` prop anymore. Simply provide an `icon` without `children` and the size should be `small`.

---

- `extend` &rarr; We removed this behavior, we recommend to still use a `icon` + `text (children)`..

---

- `iconSize` &rarr; Button do not support `iconSize` prop, the icon size is define internally depending on variant/size to make it consistent.
