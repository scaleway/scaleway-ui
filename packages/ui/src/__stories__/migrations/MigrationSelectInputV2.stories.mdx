# Migrate SelectInput to SelectInputV2

Welcome to the migration of SelectInput into SelectInputV2, here we will see how to easily migrate to SelectInputV2 component.

## Properties to migrate
- `children` (ReactNode) => `options`{'(Record<string, OptionType[]> | OptionType[])'}
- `isDisabled`(boolean) => `disabled` (boolean)
- `emptyState`{'((obj: {inputValue: string;}) => ReactNode) '} => `emptyState` (ReactNode)
- `isSearchable` (boolean): `searchable` (boolean)
- `isClearable` (boolean): `clearable` (boolean)
- `inlineDescription` (string): `description`, defined directly in the options props
-`value`(string | selectOption): `value` (OptionType)

## Removed Properties
- `additionalStyles` (CSSInterpolation)
- `checked` (boolean)
- `labelId` (string)
- `time` (boolean)
- `customStyle`: You can directly customize the options style by passing a ReactNode as a label for the options
- `animation` (string)
- `animationDuration` (number)
- `noTopLabel` (boolean): Simply do not pass a label
- `animationOnChange` (boolean)
- `customComponents`
- `loading`

## `options` prop
Options are now only passed as a prop, not children. They can be of two types, one for grouped options and one for ungrouped options. Each option is of type `OptionType` with the following properties: 
- `value` (string): value of the option. _This prop is required_.
- `label` (ReactNode): label to display in the dropdown and on the selectBar when the option is selected. _This prop is required_.
- `disabled` (boolean): whether the option is disabled. _This prop is required_.
- `description` (string): more information on the option. The description can be placed at the right or beneath the option label in the dropdown with the prop `direction`, which is **global**. _This prop is optional_.
- `optionalInfo` (ReactNode): if there is badges or icons to add next to the label (left or right) which are not meant to be visible when the option is selected. Its position is **globally** set using the prop `optionalInfoPlacement`. _This prop is optional_.
- `searchText` (string): define here what should the user search to get this option. _This prop is optional_.
