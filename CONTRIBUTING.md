## Creating an Issue

You have an issue with Ultraviolet UI or you want to propose a new creative feature? First things first: [check that this issue hasn't been already opened or solved](https://github.com/scaleway/ultraviolet/issues). ðŸ”Ž

**You found a closed issue about a bug, but it's still here?**

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/scaleway/ultraviolet/issues/new/choose) mentioning closed issue with all details: how to reproduce it, screenshots and videos if you can.

**You didn't find any corresponding issue?**

You can now [open an issue](https://github.com/scaleway/ultraviolet/issues/new/choose) and choose most fitting template! Collect and describe as much information as possible.
If you're opening an issue about a bug or a fix please describe how to reproduce, put some screenshots and even videos if you can.

## Versioning

Ultraviolet uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), this means that each version is composed of 3 numbers: major, minor and patch.

- **Major**: When you make incompatible API changes.
- **Minor**: When you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- **Patch**: When you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

When a pull request is merged, a release pull request will be created automatically, you will need to merge it in order to publish the new version (2 approvals are needed).

## Creating a pull request

You are a developer and wants to play part in this project? Lucky us!

In order to publish your changes here is what you need to do:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork on your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/ultraviolet.git
cd ultraviolet
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scaleway/ultraviolet.git
```

3. Synchronize your local main branch with the upstream one:

```shell
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

4. Create a new branch:

```shell
git checkout -b fix/my-branch
```

5. Install dependencies and start storybook to test your modifications:

```shell
pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm run start
```

6. Make your code modifications and test them locally:

```shell
pnpm run test:unit
```

If you have an error with unit test please check corresponding test and try to resolve the issue.
Generating snapshot might be required depending on modification.

7. Generate a changeset file for the changelog history:

```shell
pnpm changeset
```

You will need to choose between `major`, `minor` or `patch` version. This will generate a file in the `.changeset` folder. Please refer to [versioning](#versioning) section to understand when to use which version.

8. Commit using [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and push your changes:

```shell
pnpm run commit
```

and then:

```shell
git push -u origin HEAD
```

9. Come back on our repository and create a [pull request](https://github.com/scaleway/ultraviolet/compare).

Congratulation! Now you just need to wait for 2 reviews from our core team, your pull request will either be merged, request changes or closed with an explanation.

## Commit & Pull Request Guideline

We have specific rules on how to structure of our commit messages to make them easy to read.

### Structure

Here is simple structure:

```
type(scope): commit message
```

Where types are defined just below, scope defines the subject and commit message should be a more precise definition of what has been changed.

Example: I'm working on a fix on Button component by changing behavior on click event. Commit message & pull request title will be:

```
fix(button): fade in animation on click
```

### Types

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **revert**: If the commit revert a previous commit

## Hotfix

It can happen that you need to fix a bug on a stable version, in this case you need to create a hotfix branch from the stable version and then create a pull request on this branch. The process is the same as [creating a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request) but you need to create a hotfix branch from the stable version.
