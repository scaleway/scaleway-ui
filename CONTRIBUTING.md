## Commit & Pull Request Guideline

We have specific rules on how to structure of our commit messages to make them easy to read.

### Structure

Here is simple structure:

```
type(scope): commit message
```

Where types are defined just below, scope defines the subject and commit message should be a more precise definition of what has been changed.

Example: I'm working on a fix on Button component by changing behavior on click event. Commit message & pull request title will be:

```
fix(button): fade in animation on click
```

### Types

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **revert**: If the commit revert a previous commit
