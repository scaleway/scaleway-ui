# Scaleway UI Core

> :warning: This library is still WIP. We are actively working on it. Our goal is to have an easy-to-use UI system. This includes an exhaustive documentation, improved DX, confidence in testing and a lot of refactoring to have consistency across our components.

> :warning: We are going to break a lot of things towards V1. This library is not yet production ready.

📝 You can still participate in its development and [start contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to it.


Scaleway UI Core contains the core features of the Scaleway UI library. 
It is set of React library that can be used to build fast application.

- [Scaleway UI](./packages/ui): The main library that includes a set of components and utilities to build fast application.
- [Scaleway Form](./packages/form): A library to build forms with Scaleway UI components, it is using React Final Form under the hood.
- [Scaleway Themes](./packages/themes): A set of themes for the Scaleway UI library (default theme is included in `@scaleway/ui`).

## Installation

### Quick start

```sh
$ pnpm add @scaleway/ui @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

### Documentation

- #### [Scaleway UI](./packages/ui)
- #### [Scaleway Form](./packages/form)
- #### [Scaleway Theme](./packages/themes)

## Development

Before any command, install dependencies running following command:

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

### Storybook

Our storybook includes both `@scaleway/ui` and `@scaleway/form`.

In order to start storybook without errors you will need to build the project once 
(this is because `@scaleway/form` uses `@scaleway/ui` build to run).

```sh
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm run start
```

Storybook documentation will then be available on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

### Test

#### Unit

```sh
$ pnpm run test:unit # Will run all tests
$ pnpm run test:unit:update # Will update all snapshots
$ pnpm run test:unit:watch # Will watch tests and only rerun the one who are modified
$ pnpm run test:unit:coverage # Will generate a coverage report
$ pnpm run testunit::coverage --coverageReporters lcov && open coverage/lcov-report/index.html # Will generate an open an html code coverage report
```

#### Accessibility

```sh
$ pnpm run test:a11y # Will run all accessibility tests
$ pnpm run test:a11y src/components/Alert # Will run accessibility test of Alert component only
```

#### Lint

```sh
$ pnpm run lint
$ pnpm run lint:fix
```

### Build

```sh
$ pnpm run build
$ pnpm run build:profile # Will open a visual representation of the modules inside the compile package
```

### Use a locally built package

You might want to test your local changes against a React application.

> [`yalc`](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc) is a tool aiming to simplify working with local npm packages by providing a different workflow than `npm/pnpm link`, hence avoiding most of their issues with module resolving.

```bash
$ pnpm install --global yalc # Make sure to have the yalc binary
```

Here is an example for using `@scaleway/ui` as a local package:

```bash
$ pnpm run build && cd packages/ui && yalc publish
$ # Now it's ready to install in your project
$ cd ../project-something
$ yalc add @scaleway/ui
$ cd ../scaleway-ui
$ # If you do some changes into your package
$ pnpm run build && yalc publish --push --sig # --push will automatically update the package on projects where it have been added, --sig updates the signature hash to trigger webpack update
```

You can redo the same with `@scaleway/form` if you want to test it.

> :warning: since [1.0.0.pre.51 (2021-04-23)](https://github.com/wclr/yalc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100pre51-2021-04-23), `yalc publish` needs the `--sig` option to trigger webpack module actual update.

> :warning: `yalc` create a `yalc.lock` and updates the `package.json` in the target project. **Make sure to not commit these changes**

---

## Versioning

We enforce the [conventionnal commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) convention in order to infer package bump versions and generate changelog.

Only the `feat`, `fix` and `perf` types will generate a new package on the `main` branch
