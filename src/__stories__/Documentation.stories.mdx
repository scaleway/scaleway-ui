# Documentation Guidelines

<Description>
  This page explains what are the guidelines for writing documentation for
  components.
</Description>

## How to

To explain how to make this documentation we will use component `<Button>` as example.
Below you will find an example on how the documentation should be written and ordered, with title, descriptions,
sub-titles, etc. You will also find a file `story.example` that you can use as a base when adding a new component.

**Here are the rules to follow**:

1. Define **PropTypes** and **DefaultProps** of a component and add `<ArgsTable>` at the end of the documentation of your component.

2. Pattern should be:

- Title
- Description
- Option title
- Description (optional)
- Example
- Option title
- Description (optional)
- Example
- API

3. When writing your story you should set a name with uppercase and spaces. Example:

```js
<Story name="My Custom Story & Co">...</Story>
```

4. Add `disabled` example of your component in the documentation.

5. Try to use **all the props** your component can take.

## Example

<Description of={Button}>
  This is a beautiful description of my component.
