# Documentation Guidelines

<Description>
  This page explains what are the guidelines for writing documentation for
  components.
</Description>

## How to

To explain how to make this documentation we will use component `<Button>` as example.
Below you will find an example on how the documentation should be written and ordered, with title, descriptions,
sub-titles, etc. You will also find a file `story.example` that you can use as a base when adding a new component.

It's important to **define PropTypes and DefaultProps of a component** so StoryBook will show them in API using `<ArgsTable>` component.

Pattern should be:

- Title
  - Description
    - Option title
      - Description (optional)
      - Example
    - Option title
      - Description (optional)
      - Example
    - API

**Note: Please always add a disabled option of your component in the documentation**

## Example

# Button

<Description of={Button}>
  This is a beautiful description of my component.
</Description>

## Basic

<Description>
  If needed you can re-write another description for this specific option, but
  it is optional.
</Description>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="basic">
    <Button>Button</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Variants

<Description>
  If needed you can re-write another description for this specific option, but
  it is optional.
</Description>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="variant">
    <Button variant="primary" mr={2}>
      Button
    </Button>
    <Button variant="success" mr={2}>
      Button
    </Button>
    <Button variant="warning" mr={2}>
      Button
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Disabled

<Description>
  If needed you can re-write another description for this specific option, but
  it is optional.
</Description>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="disabled">
    <Button disabled>Button</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## API

<ArgsTable of={Button} />
